# 💅🏾 Code, But Make it Cute

## 👋🏾 About this Project
Welcome to Code, But Make it Cute! Here you'll find notes and CodePen starter templates that accompany the talk given by [Bree Hall](https://tiktok.com/@bytesofbree) (that's me!) at [BaddieCon](www.baddiesintech.com/baddiecon) during the summer of 2024.

This is a fun beginner friendly presentation on creative coding with HTML and CSS. It’s all about mixing code with creativity, and building for the purpose of fun and enjoyment.

## 🗺 What's Included
This repo contains the code for two HTML & CSS based projects. Final code for each project can be found in the `src/` directory.
